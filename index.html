## Howdy!
I'm a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, where I study statistics as a [Robertson Scholar](https://robertsonscholars.org/). I'm also an [Emerging Reporter](https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-propublicas-emerging-reporters-for-the-2021-school-year) for ProPublica.

I previously reported for [The Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/about/staff/kalley-huang/), [The Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/author/kalley-huang), and the [El Paso Times](https://www.elpasotimes.com/staff/3214965001/kalley-huang/).
