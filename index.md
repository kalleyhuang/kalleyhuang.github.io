Howdy!

I'm a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, where I study statistics as a [Robertson Scholar](https://robertsonscholars.org/). I'm also an [Emerging Reporter](https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-propublicas-emerging-reporters-for-the-2021-school-year) for ProPublica.

I previously reported for [The Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/about/staff/kalley-huang/), [The Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/author/kalley-huang), and the [El Paso Times](https://www.elpasotimes.com/staff/3214965001/kalley-huang/). 

For the Tribune, I tracked [coronavirus in public schools](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/17/texas-schools-covid-19-cases/) and helped to build our [redistricting look-up](https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2021/texas-redistricting-map/).

In Dallas, I reported on how [Texas universities](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2021/07/15/why-are-so-few-black-professors-tenured-texas-has-made-little-progress-despite-promises-of-change/) have made functionally no progress in diversifying faculty and how [bail funds](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2021/07/03/texas-community-bail-funds-grow-sparked-by-summer-black-lives-matter-protests/) in North Texas freed people jailed during protests.

In El Paso, I wrote about [trauma surgeons](https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/local/el-paso/2020/08/01/el-paso-august-3-2019-walmart-mass-shooting-trauma-surgeons-umc-recall-shock-aftermath/5540583002/) who cared for the victims of the Walmart mass shooting and broke news on the death of a [Mexican woman](https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2020/08/10/family-mexican-woman-who-fell-border-wall-nm-seeks-answers/3319763001/) after she reportedly fell from a border fence.
